# 003-world_cup_odds

## Summary

This was a project to visualise the twists and turns of the World Cup. I started by scraping outright winner odds from the Oddschecker website at regular intervals during each world cup game. This process was conducted using Selenium and GitHub Actions. The scraping code is contained in {this .py file}[https://github.com/ajhillman-ddj/003-world_cup_odds/blob/main/01-web_scraping_oddschecker_site.ipynb]
